## Oliv's Web Components

> Note: _Those components requires **absolutely NO** external library._
> (No Knockout, Require, jQuery, etc).

> But EcmaScript6 (ES6) is required.

> Some components might require some provided utilities like
> - `character.matrixes/characters.js`
> - `stars/constellation.js`
> - `utilities/Utilities.js`

They do require a WebComponents-savvy browser though. Most of them are (or will shortly be...).

### Live Demos
Requires `nodejs` to be available on your system.

To see the components at work, after cloning the repo, start the `node` server _**from the `WebComponents` directory**_, and load `index.html` in a browser:

```bash
 $> node server.js
```
Then load [http://localhost:8080/oliv-components/index.html](http://localhost:8080/oliv-components/index.html) in a WebComponents-enabled web browser.

#### Also available
After starting the `node` server as mentioned above, you can also reach
- [http://localhost:8080/oliv-components/mirror.html](http://localhost:8080/oliv-components/mirror.html), the basis for an Head-Up Display (HUD) application.
- [http://localhost:8080/oliv-components/pwm.html](http://localhost:8080/oliv-components/pwm.html), for an explanation about how Pulse Width Modulation works.

### Hosted
- See it live [here](http://raspberrypi.lediouris.net/webcomponents/index.html).

##### Artifacts
- Javascript Modules (careful with Firefox 58 and below...)
    - defining the component's parameters (properties) and behavior
- Examples, in `index.html` and on [`CodePen`](http://codepen.io/OlivierLD/).
    - including animations examples
- CSS rules and classes (in their own stylesheet, `web-components.css`)

---

#### TODO
- JSDoc

#### CodePen (might not be 100% in sync... But close'ish)
The point of truth remains this repo.

Components above, live at [CodePen](http://codepen.io/OlivierLD/), when released.

- [Jumbo Display](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/VQyVjy).
- [Pluviometer](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/oEPKgg).
- [Thermometer](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/KQQEEp).
- [Direction](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/bLjwdj).
- [Analog Display](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/QQBYEw).
- [Compass Rose](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/aqaLQq).
- [World Map](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/xYQbmb).
- [Calendar Display](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/EpOJEW).
- [SkyMap/StarFinder](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/project/full/APNqRk).
- [Split-Flap Display](https://codepen.io/OlivierLD/pen/LJLbeQ).

#### HTML Templates &amp; Imports
Along the same lines as Web Components, for re-usability, modularity, etc.
See the examples in this module.

#### Firefox 58
If you are having trouble running the WebComponents in Firefox 58, see
[this document](https://www.designedbyaturtle.co.uk/2015/how-to-enable-web-components-in-firefox-shadow-dom/).

#### Transpilation
Use `babel`, as explained [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/). Also see
[this document](widgets/README.md) in the same project.

There is also a [transpiler on-line](http://babeljs.io/en/repl.html), that works correctly.

##### Scripted Transpilation
See [this document](widgets/README.md).
